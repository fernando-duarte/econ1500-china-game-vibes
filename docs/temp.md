File has too many lines (211) . Maximum allowed is 200 lines. Please split this file into smaller, more focused modules with single responsibilities. Consider extracting utility functions, separating components, or moving complex logic

We added detailed documentation on how to refactor long files.
These changes will help maintain code quality and prevent the accumulation of overly complex files in the future.
Next steps could include:
Refactoring the existing long files according to the guidelines
Creating more specific type definitions for the project
Adding additional code quality rules to ESLint
